**Project Name:** Human Progression: Device Trust and Security Awareness  
**Team:** Stickers  
**Event:** BYUâ€“Idaho Hackathon

## Overview  

This project demonstrates how a simple USB device, such as an Arduino Leonardo, can act as a keyboard and automatically type commands when plugged into a computer. It was created as an ethical and educational tool to teach people an important lesson: never plug an unknown device into your computer.  

Many people trust technology without realizing how that trust can be abused. This project focuses on raising awareness and helping people become more thoughtful and informed as technology continues to progress.

## Why It Matters  

Technology is advancing quickly, but human awareness must grow with it. The theme of Human Progression reminds us that progress is not just about innovation but also about understanding and responsibility.  

Our goal is to help people recognize that some individuals are willing to spend time creating harmful tools that take advantage of human curiosity and trust. By understanding this risk, people can become more careful and protect themselves and their information.

## Ethical Commitment  

This demonstration is completely safe. It does not collect or steal information and does not harm the computer in any way. The code only opens Notepad and types a short, friendly message.  

We perform this project only on devices we own or on computers where we have full permission from the owner. The purpose of this work is to educate and spread awareness about digital responsibility and device safety.

## How It Works  

The Arduino Leonardo can act as a keyboard. When plugged into a computer, it sends key presses as if a person were typing.  

In this safe demonstration, the device simply opens Notepad and types a harmless message. This shows how easily a trusted device can perform automated actions, which helps people understand why awareness is important.

## Key Takeaways  

- Never plug in USB devices from unknown or untrusted sources.  
- Pay close attention to pop-ups and permission windows before clicking any buttons.  
- Remember that malicious individuals may create realistic or convincing tools to trick others.  
- Building small safety habits, like verifying devices and using trusted sources, can prevent serious problems.
